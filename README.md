# VitGui

So what I'm pretty much doing is rewritting [this](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php/RbxGui).

Because I've been told that their library is a bit buggy and ugly and I need something to develop so yeah. 

Watch me claw my hair out.

# Changelog

1.0: No idea where to start

# Updates that might happen

1. With each library make it have so called "events" that will make that library able to be replicated to every player
that joins the game, leaves the game etc.
